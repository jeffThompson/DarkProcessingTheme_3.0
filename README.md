Dark Processing Theme (for 3.0)
===================

A dark theme for the Processing IDE (a little easier on the eyes!) for Processing 3.0.

For a Processing 2.0 theme, see [this repository](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_2.0), for P5 1.5, see [this repo](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme).

## MAC INSTALLATION  
**PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine.

**LIB FOLDER**  
Look in `~/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/lib`.
Replace the files in your folder using the ones from this repository's `lib` folder (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!). This contains lots of changes, including all the button files. ***Don't copy the entire folder! Recent versions of the Processing app include files that, if removed, will break the IDE.***

## WINDOWS INSTALLATION  
**PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine, located in '%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Processing\'.

**LIB FOLDER**  
Look in '%HomeDrive%\processing64\processing-3.2.1\lib\'.  
[ See Mac instructions above for what to do. ]

## LINUX  
If you're on Linux, you like a challenge – I'm sure you can figure this one out 😊
